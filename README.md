# Flutter Firebase

Welcome to my project! This is a mobile app that allows users to log in and sign up using their email and password, or by using a third-party authentication provider such as Google or Facebook. The app also includes a chat feature that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

You can install these dependencies by following the instructions on the Flutter and Firebase websites.
